Candidate Task
Feedback Collector
Objective
This task is designed to evaluate your ability to develop a complete, working microapplication with attention to user experience, frontend precision, backend logic, and
deployment readiness. The focus is not on building something complex, but on how well you
execute something simple with care, clarity, and professionalism.
Scope of Work
Develop a single-page feedback collector application. The purpose is to allow users to submit
their name, email address, and a short feedback message. These feedback entries should be
stored and retrievable through a basic admin view built into the same interface.
This task must include both frontend and backend functionality, and the final result should
be deployed online.
Expectations
Frontend
Use React (with either Vite or Next.js)
Clean, responsive layout
Use of modern design patterns – minimalistic, well-aligned, visually intuitive
Styling using Tailwind CSS or similar framework is preferred
Include a clearly visible watermark in the footer with your name and submission info
Form must include:
Full Name (text input)
Email (with basic validation)
Feedback message (text area)
Submit button with loading state
Admin View
Toggle button: “View Submitted Feedback”
When clicked, display all collected feedbacks
Feedback display should be styled (list or card layout – avoid raw JSON dumps)
Backend
A backend API or serverless function that performs the following:
POST /submit-feedback: Accepts feedback and stores it
GET /feedbacks: Returns all feedback entries
You may use Netlify Functions, Firebase, Supabase, or JSON-based storage
Hosting
The frontend must be deployed on Netlify
Backend can be part of Netlify Functions, or hosted elsewhere as long as it’s reachable
Bonus (Optional but Encouraged)
Mobile responsiveness across devices
Timestamp for each submission
Dark/light theme toggle
Thoughtful transitions or micro animations
Form-level validation with user-friendly messages
Submission Requirements
Netlify deployment link
Public GitHub repository with clear commit history
Proper README explaining the project structure, tech stack, and deployment steps
Add Full Name - Watermark or credit included in the live version footer.
